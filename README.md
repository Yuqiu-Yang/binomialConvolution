# Binomial Convolution Model Parameter Estimation

![Logo](/assets/logo.png)

Binomial Convolution distribution is generated by the summation of a series of independent but not necessarily identically distributed binomial distributions. 

Given the number of components $J$, the number of trials $\mathbf{M} = [M_1, \cdots, M_J]$, and success probabilities $\mathbf{p}=[p_1, \cdots, p_J]$, a random variable $Y$ follows a Binomial Convolution distribution or simply BC($\mathbf{M},~ \mathbf{p}$) if $Y = \sum_{j=1}^JX_j,$ where $X_j \overset{ind}{\sim} \text{Binomial}(M_j, p_j)$

In this case, we say,
$Y \sim \text{BC}(\mathbf{M},~ \mathbf{p})$
<!-- Suppose we are given a set of $N$ IID samples $Y_1, \cdots, Y_N$ from some Binomial Convolution distribution, the goals of this project are then 

1. Given $Y_1, \cdots, Y_N$, and $\mathbf{M}$, estimate $\mathbf{p}$
2. Given $Y_1, \cdots, Y_N$, and $J$, estimate $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{p}$
3. Given $Y_1, \cdots, Y_N$, estimate $J$, $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{p}$ -->

This R packages provides several functionalities from simulation to estimation of parameters of a Binomial Convolution distribution.  

> [!WARNING] 
We are still actively working on the functions in the package. Proceed with caution. 

## Dependencies 

- R>=4.0.2

## Installation

```shell
library(devtools)
install_github("Yuqiu-Yang/binomialConvolution",subdir="binomialConvolution", ref="main")
```

Other than making sure your R version is correct, there is no need for 
you to manually install other packages as they will be automatically 
installed when installing our package.
